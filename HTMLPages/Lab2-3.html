        <ul>
        <li>Program design focuses on breaking down the program into smaller, more manageable components. Various tools are used to help design a program.</li>
        <li>Commonly used tools: </li>    
            <ul  style="list-style-type: circle; background-color: #C5DECD">
            <li>Structure Charts</li>

            <li>Flow Charts</li>    
            <li>Decision Tables</li>

        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Once the program has been designed, a developer than writes the code.</li>
        <li>Coding often involves translating the design from charts and pseduocode into a specific programming language. <br>
            Usually the language is chosen during the "defining" stage.</li>    
        
        </ul>
        
        
        <h1> <li>Testing and Debugging</li> </h1>
        
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>After code has been written this stage revolves around fixing any bugs in the program.</li>
        <li>There are two kinds of errors that cause bugs: </li>
            <ol type = "a" style = "background-color: #C5DECD">
            <li>Syntax Errors: These are like grammatical mistakes in the code.</li>
            <li>Logical Error: These mistakes might cause an other than intended output but the code still works.</li>
            </ol>
        <li>The programmer must fix these mistakes by carefully examining the already written code for errors.</li>    
        
        
        </ul>
        
        <h1><li>Documentation</li> </h1>
        
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>After coding has been completed, the programmer must write a nmanual that generally contains the following: </li>
        <ol style = "background-color: #C5DECD" type = "a" >
            <li>An overview of the programs functionality.</li>
            <li>In-depth explanations of program features.</li>
            <li>Documentation of all commands.</li>
            <li>A thorough description of error messages generated by the program.</li>
            </ol>
          
        </ul>
        
        
        <h1> <li>Deploying and Maintaining the Program</li> </h1>
        
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>A software team will be responsible for fixing new errors and updating the software with new features.</li>
        <li>When a new feature should be added to the program, the cycle restarts as developers begin to define what problem the new feature will solve.</li>
